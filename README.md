# get-and-compare-file-from-API
 This project was initiated with the goal of completing a task in my company.

 The goal was fetch data from our API, make it JSON and save in a file.

 This algorithm can be used to fetch as many entrypoint as it need. 

 For multiple entry points you can use the sample object in line 3 to specify, id, type, name...

 In the const endpoints is where you will specify your enpoints.

 The file testapi is where you will declare your api url, also the of your files to be saved.

 The Json file will be created at the smae folder as the project. If new information is fetched will be replaced.
